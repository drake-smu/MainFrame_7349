# Data Generation  

## Low Density 192-bit

* 1 data set = 300 sequences
* 1 sequence = 8257 ciphertext blocks 
* For each sequence, different random plaintext block was used
* ciphertext block 1 used key of all 0's 
* 2-129 is all 0's with the 1 moving through all possible positions (of the first 128 bits of the key)
* 130 - 8257 is key with two 1's in every possible position combination (of the first 128 bits of the key)
