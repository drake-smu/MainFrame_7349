# Security Project DS7349 (Spring 2019)  

## Directories

* **Code** : Code goes in here, should be broken up into subdirectories for 
block creation and randomness testing.
* **Reports** : Documents and reporting go in here. Try to organize by named 
document so that templates and resources don't get mixed.
* **Notes** : This is a misc directory to keep notes or add relevant info to the project.
